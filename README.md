# plantfam

PlantFam is a hobby project. My goal is to track all of my plant care more easily by maintaining a list of the plant species, and the instances of each species that I own, as well as the types of care I provide to them, and when. I currently track this all in a spreadsheet and it is awful. I want to visit a website from my phone and make my watering and fertilizing updates without having to go to my computer to track it.

There are many much better apps out there that do something very similar to this. But I want exactly what I want, and it is a good excuse to improve my familiarity with the available tools.

All of the plant data is saved in a MySQL database.

The API will start out using Flask, but I may experiment with FastAPI down the road.

The Front End will likely be implemented with React.
